## Installation

To get started with ListViewKit, you can install it via CocoaPods. Add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'ListViewKit'
```

Then run:

```bash
pod install
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cafezinho0/ListViewKit.git
```

## Usage

To use ListViewKit, simply import it into your project:

```swift
import ListViewKit
```

Then, create a new ListView instance:

```swift
let listView = ListView()
```

You can set your data source and delegate to manage the data displayed in the list. Here's a simple example:

```swift
listView.dataSource = self
listView.delegate = self
```

Make sure to implement the required methods for the data source and delegate to provide data and handle user interactions.

## Examples

### Basic Example

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation:

```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, ListViewDataSource, ListViewDelegate {
    var items: [String] = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        let listView = ListView()
        listView.dataSource = self
        listView.delegate = self
        view.addSubview(listView)
    }

    func numberOfItems(in listView: ListView) -> Int {
        return items.count
    }

    func listView(_ listView: ListView, itemAt index: Int) -> String {
        return items[index]
    }
}
```

### Advanced Features

ListViewKit also supports advanced features like animations and custom layouts. You can define your own layout by subclassing `ListViewLayout` and implementing the required methods.

```swift
class CustomLayout: ListViewLayout {
    // Implement custom layout logic here
}
```
